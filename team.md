## Dr. Nabarun Dasgupta
*Innovation Fellow at UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health*
<br><br>
Dr. Dasgupta co-created the mobile app for patient reporting of side effects for US [FDA Medwatcher](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-reporting-mdr-how-report-medical-device-problems/medwatcher-mobile-app), UK [Yellow Card app](https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update/yellow-card-app-download-the-updated-app-to-receive-the-latest-mhra-safety-news-and-report-suspected-side-effects-including-in-pregnancy), Netherlands [Bijwerking app](https://www.lareb.nl/news/nieuw-bijwerking-app), and the [platform](https://web-radr.eu/mobile-apps/med-safety/features-and-functionality/) used in the Middle East and Africa. He has worked with patient groups to drastically improve side effect reporting to regulators in terms of quantity and quality. He pioneered the use of social media for detecting previously unrecognized side effects ([here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4013443/), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5362648/), [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364798/), protocols still used by [top pharmaceutical companies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5311422/). Nabarun helped [PoisonHelp.org](http://poisonhelp.org/), a similar triage/crowdsourcing tool for poisonings. He is also on the Editorial Board at the journal Drug Safety, the international clearing house for scholarly work on side effects, as well as being the surveillance methods section editor for American Journal of Public Health. Early in his career, he conducted lab research on the adenovirus vectors, like those being used in major vaccines.

Benjamin White will be the full stack software engineer on the project, continuing his collaboration with this team. He created the semi-automated infrastructure that aggregates COVID mobility datasets currently. He is the owner of Rhizomik Tech, a small business supporting open science academic research. He has industry experience architecting complex data science projects, as well as teaching software development; he holds double master’s degrees in sociology and linguistic anthropology. His engineering capabilities relevant to this project include: Python, Pandas, Flask, Javascript React, Django, Node, GitHub, R, Julia, JupyterHub, Docker, and Kubernetes

## Dr. Allison Lazard
*Associate Professor at UNC Hussman School of Media and Journalism*
<br><br>
Dr. Lazard has a strong background in visual design research for health communication, including examining the impact of data visualization on consumer knowledge and behavior. She has 15 years of experience in research, creative development, and evaluation of health communication messages, including how messages influence public health policy. In particular, her research revolves around a core interest in how visual design influences perception of and engagement with health communication, including reporting data to lay audiences. She brings expertise regarding visual and communication strategies to increase (or decrease) the effectiveness of messages delivering critical health information for health behavior change.
