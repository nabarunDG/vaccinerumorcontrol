**Concept note to develop COVID vaccine side effect chatbot**<br>

![COVID Vaccine Rumor Control](/docs/RumorControl_masks_chiron2.png)
<br>
<br>
## Software Development Process
The first part of the site assessing side effect rumors could be built using existing simple commercially available blogging software with syndication capabilities. The chatbot will be developed with a Python back end, Django web deployment, and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/messaging) messaging functionality. The core functionality could be re-purposed for other public health messaging.
<br><br>
We have identified a UNC contract developer who is qualified and available to build the web app, chatbot, admin interface, and backend.
