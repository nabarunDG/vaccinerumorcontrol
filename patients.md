## Patient Perspective

Two central patient experiences are to wonder if a side effect is caused by the vaccine or drug, and to wonder how long the side effect is expected to last. We recently asked patient advocates what could be done to help patients report and understand COVID vaccine side effects. Our chatbot demo is based directly on their wisdom. Hear what they have to say in the video below.<br><br><br>
