![COVID Vaccine Rumor Control](/docs/RumorControl_masks_chiron2.png)<br>
*We want COVID vaccines to succeed and get on with our lives. And, reports of “90%+ effective” have primed the public to expect miracles. But, vaccine acceptability will be contingent on a yet nebulous profile of safety. Therefore, we must proactively evaluate side effect reports and optimize vetted information for dissemination. We are not throwin’ away our shot.*

# Mission
To factcheck vaccine side effect rumors and results in real-time. To deliver vetted information to the public effectively.<br>

```We are soliciting interest and funding to rapidly build a lightweight science-as-a-service tool for Jan-Feb deployment. The rumor control website will require scientific expertise, message crafting will require scicomms exerts, and the chatbot will require software developers. Please WhatsApp (+1-919-260-3808) or email nab@unc.edu if interested.```

# Audience and Misinformation Strategy
Conventional wisdom about vaccine misinformation has disproportionately focused on the lurid fringe. [Scientists](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2281-1) and [journalists](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/anti-vax-metastasized-on-the-media?tab=summary) studying viral misinformation suggest a different strategy. **Our target audience is the middle-of-the-pack, to prevent progression to the fringe at a specific moment of vulnerability.** It is the interaction between undecided populations and anti-vaccination clusters that leads to wild misinformation spread. 

>Instead of the undecided population being passively persuaded by the anti- or pro-vaccination populations, undecided individuals are highly active: the undecided clusters have the highest growth of new out-links, followed by anti-vaccination clusters. Moreover, it is the undecided clusters who are entangled with the anti-vaccination clusters in the main network patch that tend to show this high out-link growth. These findings challenge our current thinking that undecided individuals are a passive background population in the battle for ‘hearts and minds’.<br>
> [Johnson et al. in *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2281-1)

All the more so for COVID vaccines. We expect that minor side effects are a priming experience for online searches that are likely to return misinformation. [Our previous work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26635479/) has shown that professional dismissal of *technically* "minor" side effects is interpreted as a lack of compassion that drives patients to online communities for empathy. *We hypothesize that while a patient is convalescing with minor vaccine side effects, they will search for and be more likely to entertain conspiracy theories about why they feel sick.* Imagine the live steam of a patient lying in a darkened bedroom, miserable with fever and muscle aches ([already happening](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/misinformation)), the ideal clickbait for in-network sharing during early mass vaccination. A pro-public health framing would norm the experience and encourage others to get vaccinated despite. Alternatively, even middle-of-the-pack patients may lace their livestream with fringe theories, even while saying they dismiss them, but the powerful visual of the darkened bedroom and audio cues of the shaky voice will have more saliency than their words. Audiences will draw their own conclusions.<br>
<br>
These are the most dangerous types of videos, we feel, because they are shared to people within their own networks with whom they have pre-established credibility, and can be easily remixed out of context for intents more nefarious. We assume pre-vaccination information will be noisy and ubiquitous. Yet, there are **two specific moments to intervene**.
1. **At vaccination: What to expect** - Overburdened medical service providers will have to set expectations in person. Even though these expectations are required and repeated disclosures in COVID vaccine RCTs, [some patients do not recall](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1022?fbclid=IwAR1glSi-0GalPGx1ASJDzDPfyu91Wk-ODA_NbIYGlz2xrpjCRtceIdrcsPQ) having been told what to expect. In higher throughput primary care, this problem will be worse. More tools and resources will be dedicated to this obvious point of message failure as the vaccine is deployed, and those efforts are welcomed.
2. **Side effect onset: What is normal** - Less recognized are the cognitively vulnerable "poor-me" hours as side effects manifest. The onset of side effects is likely to prompt digital sleuthing and reaching out to trusted family and friends. A Google search is predictable, and our efforts are to pre-empt entry into conspiracy-laden networks. [Psychology of conspiracy theories](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417718261) reveals that people are likely to turn to conspiracy theories when they are anxious and feel powerless. Therefore, our fundamental proposition is to provide reliable choice-oriented information and comfort suggestions at side effect onset.

# Watch the Demo
Mass vaccinations, common side effects, and ubiquitous mobile phones mean millions will be searching for reliable information on handhelds. In this [1 minute demo video](https://vimeo.com/486023188) we show how to answer three essential questions regarding side effects that patients find most important.
1. Is it vaccine-related?
2. How long will it last?
3. What should I do now?

<br><br>
<a href="https://vimeo.com/486023188" rel="demo video">![](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/vimeo_demo4.png)</a>
<br><br>
The three essential questions were identified from our experience [deploying mobile apps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4656696/), [monitoring social media](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6858385/), and most importantly, [listening to patients](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/patients). Platform development is oriented towards SMS because the technology is low threshold and widespread. WhatsApp integration and an embeddable web-based chatbot API are also envisioned. Non-minor and ambiguous events will be referred to clincians and pharmacists, with links for [official adverse event reporting](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-09/COVID-03-Shimabukuro.pdf).

<br><br>

# User Generated Data
Anonymized user-generated text can be mined for shifts in public sentiment and provide specific real-time targets for countering misinformation. Private text exchanges with a bot may provide different insight than other data sources. Unlike search engine trends and social media monitoring, we will be able to query the time between vaccination and onset of symptoms. Time-to-onset is the [single most important](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6447519/) element to determining if a side effect was caused by the vaccine. But, the real goal of this project is to provide an avenue for meaningful information (pharmacovigilance is not the primary intent). Data privacy and retention policies will favor public trust over research interests.
<br><br>

# Insights
From years of deploying patient-centric health apps, we proceed with 4 central insights.

**1. The "worried well" need encouragement to get second doses**<br>
Offering encouragement to those with minor expected side effects will be essential to overcome hesitancy for regimen completion. Triaging the worried well also aids the healthcare system from being overrun. <br>
<br>
**2. Syndication speeds uptake**<br>
To rise above pandemic media saturation, a data tool must be easily propogated while fulfilling a fundamental public need, as the success of COVID tracker APIs demonstrates.<br>
<br>
**3. Patients expect instant feedback**<br>
As described in this [video](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/patients.md), patients with side effects expect instant and compassionate feedback. <br>
<br>
**4. Patients are reluctant to download single-use reporting apps**<br>
[Based on our experience in 4 countries](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40264-019-00813-6), mobile apps for side effect reporting have limited uptake. The forthcoming [CDC mobile app (V-SAFE)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html) focuses on *collecting* information, while [patients](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/patients.md) expect to *receive* information. Referrals to V-SAFE will be made via the chat for non-minor events. In this way, the chatbot fills unmet patient needs and serves as an entry point for official data collection.
<br><br>

# Scientific Strategy
[Our team](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/team) has experience in evaluating side effects in real-time from the public. The goal is to evaluate side effect rumors and study results in real-time. We will monitor social and news media, scientific literature, pharmaceutical industry filings, and government reports to identify emerging concerns about vaccine side effects. We will scientifically assess each new side effect ("adverse event") using data and medical knowledge to determine causality. The team will consist of experts in pharmacovigilance, pharmacoepidemiology, pharmacology, and related disciplines.
<br><br>

# Misinformation Strategy
[Our team](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/team) has experience in crafting messages and visuals to address misinformation online. We have also developed a [behavioral model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4656696/) for soliciting side effect information on mobile platforms. We will combine this expertise, and that of future collaborators, to craft and test chatbot interactions that are more salient than the demo. The [October 2020 issue of *American Journal of Public Health*](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305943) was dedicated to this topic. It's worth a read. Some relevant findings:.<br>
<br><br>
> **Notably, exposure to misinformation cannot simply be undone through fact checking, correcting, or debunking efforts**: a large body of research has shown that retractions are rarely successful at eliminating reliance on misinformation, a phenomenon known as the “continued influence” effect. Mitigating the effects of exposure to vaccine misinformation requires the development and testing of novel strategies beyond traditional vaccine education efforts.<br>
> <br>
> [Vanderpool, Gaysynsky, and Chou](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305906)
<br><br>

[Southwell, Wood, and Nevar](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305729) point out the traditional misplacement of emphasis by health professionals in addressing vaccine misinformation. <br>
<br>

>[Leask et al.](https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2431-12-154) developed a guide for health professionals to consider in addressing parental vaccination concerns. They emphasize a stance that offers **parents assistance in decision-making rather than attempting to persuade parents directly or discredit specific information sources**. Such an approach prioritizes offering informed advice on how to think about vaccine decisions rather than discrediting specific information sources.<br>
<br><br>

[Further insights](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305943) from these authors quantifies what we may have personally observed:<br>
> The longitudinal analysis of antivaccine Facebook pages in [Broniatowski et al.](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2020.305869) points to... the “freedom of choice” framing of vaccine decisions. The increased focus on civil liberties since 2015 suggests that attempts to counter vaccine misinformation will need to address political arguments, rather than solely providing facts about vaccine safety and efficacy.<br>
<br><br>

# Content Generation
Another insight is that pro-vaccination efforts remain peripheral to online social discourse because they are monothematic. Therefore, wider array of content generation is a key responsibility of this project.<br>
<br>
>Our qualitative analysis of cluster content shows that anti-vaccination clusters offer a wide range of potentially attractive narratives that blend topics such as safety concerns, conspiracy theories and alternative health and medicine, and also now the cause and cure of the COVID-19 virus... By contrast, pro-vaccination views are far more monothematic.<br>
> [Johnson et al. in *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2281-1)
<br><br>

# Tech Strategy
[Our team](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/team) has experience building and scaling NLP-based apps. We will develop a chatbot allowing users to describe symptoms and learn if they could be vaccine-related. To operationalize, three types of tools are envisioned: rumor curation tables and interface, core chatbot functionality, and real-time NLP layers to respond to user input. Bolded elements represent the anticipated MVP pathway.
<br><br>
Anticipated build components:

+ Scientist-facing backend interface to log and ajudicate rumors and results, with Git-oriented off-the-shelf tools for version control
+ **Master tables for each vaccine with known/suspected/unlikely side effects and comfort suggestions, with syndication capability (REST API, dynamic GitHub table)**
+ **Decision tree for actions**
+ A blog-style public-facing Rumor Control website ([example](https://tarheels.live/vaccine/2020/12/01/transverse-myelitis-in-astrazeneca-oxford-trial/))
+ **Real-time NLP tool (integrated with chatbot API/SDK) to interpret user responses and auto-generate text**
+ **To support NLP, a dynamic dictionary to translate vernacular symptoms to medical ontology (allowing comparison to scientific reports)**
+ **Python and Django chatbot for message testing and embedding in third-party websites**
+ [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/messaging) deployment for SMS text and WhatsApp
+ Data export capability for retrospective/static analysis

<br>

# Uptake Strategy
Uptake by end users will require concerted promotion. Ideally, materials will be provided to patients at the point of vaccination. All vaccination venues, pharmacists, and clinic offices/receptionists are potential partners. Promotion plans will be more fully developed as a team. 
<br><br> 

# Funding
Thus far this is a collaboration between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Rhizomik Tech, LLC. We are open to other collaborators. Funding could be directed at the university (scientific strategy) or the small business (tech strategy).
<br><br>
*Traditional Development*<br>
We are soliciting funding and suggestions to make this vision a reality. We would like to develop a rapid MVP by January 2021. Using standard development process we will need a software developer ($25-$43k), purchased computing resources ($30k), and a scientific project manager ($40k). Ideally, 2 research assistants ($21k each) and more programmer resources would be available, either funded, crowdsourced, or in-kind. These resources are anticipated to cover the initial build and 6 months of moderate uptake.
<br><br>
*Crowdsourced Development*<br>
Capitalizing on boredom during a socially distanced holiday and altruistic impulse, an alternate approach is to rely on crowdsourcing for much of the devleopment as an open source project. For example, scientific tasks could be distributed to separate teams: searching for rumors on TikTok, monitoring and extracting results from scientific reports, message testing, creating the vernacular-to-medical language dictionary, assesing causality and writing blog posts, analyzing user-generated text. Similarly, once an architecture has been established, tech development tasks could be crowdsourced too. However, for this model to be successful, we still need a lead software designer and a lead scientific project manager to oversee task deployment. And, we would need to excite and motivate hundreds to yield a core dozen who would do most of the work. Crowdfunding could also be envisioned. Both crowdsorucing and crowdfunding would be heavily reliant on institutional support for promotion. 
<br><br>
*Scaling Costs*<br>
In the event of high volume uptake (more than 100,000 sessions), text messaging via [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/pricing) can be scaled with volume discounts, but would require additional funding. Each chatbot session costs about $0.12 (assuming 16 send/receive messages) in the United States, and is available for paralell deployment in dozens of other countries.

### Clinical Trial Patient Experiences in the News
> "The actual injection felt, at first, just like a flu shot, which is basically just a little pinch in the side of your arm," Batalvi said. "Once I left the hospital, that evening, the stiffness got a little bit worse. It was definitely manageable, but you kind of don't really feel like moving your arm too far above your shoulder. But the side effects are pretty localized. I mean, it's just in the muscle in your arm. And that's about it. It doesn't really affect anything else and you feel fine."
> That was after the first dose. But the second dose was different.
> "I actually had some pretty significant symptoms after I got the second dose. Once I got the second dose, I was fine while I was in the hospital. But that evening was rough. I mean, I developed a low-grade fever, and fatigue and chills," Batalvi said. He said he was out for that day and evening, but he "felt ready to go by the next morning."
> He said he called the study doctors to let them know about his symptoms. They weren't alarmed and told him he shouldn't be either.<br>
> [CNN - Dec 2, 2020](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/health/coronavirus-vaccine-volunteer-side-effects/index.html)
<br>

> This summer, computational biologist Luke Hutchison volunteered for a trial of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. But after the second injection, his arm swelled up to the size of a “goose egg,” Hutchison says. He can't be sure he got the vaccine and not a placebo, but within a few hours, Hutchison, who was healthy and 43, was beset by bone and muscle aches and a 38.9°C fever. “I started shaking. I had cold and hot rushes,” he says. “I was sitting by the phone all night long thinking: ‘Should I call 911?’” Hutchison's symptoms resolved after 12 hours. But, he says, “Nobody prepared me for the severity of this.”<br>

# Comfort Suggestions for Patients
We will not be providing treatment recommendations to users. Instead, we are delivering vetted side effect information in a format that is meaningful, for example augmenting with how long symptoms might last or age-specific profiles. For the most common, easily managed, minor side effects like chills and soreness, providing general comfort suggestions (ice, arm movement exercises, standard OTC pain relievers, etc.) is entirely reasonable. We may not have to create this content ourselves, since [news media](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/#why-this-is-needed-now) are already making these suggestions. To mitigate risks we can focus on non-therapeutic comfort suggestions at launch. **Providing information that patients expect is inherent to the value proposition.** The general posture is to refer anything ambiguous or complicated to clinicians/pharmacists, as with [PoisonHelp.org](https://www.poisonhelp.org). We recognize that pharma and government authorities have traditionally shied away from comfort suggestions, but the exceptional conditions of the pandemic call for patient-centric strategies that are bolder.
