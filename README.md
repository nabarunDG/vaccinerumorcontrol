**Concept note to develop COVID vaccine side effect chatbot**<br>

![COVID Vaccine Rumor Control](/docs/RumorControl_masks_chiron2.png)
*We are not throwin’ away our shot*
<br>
<br>
We want COVID vaccines to succeed and get on with our lives. And, reports of “90%+ effective” have primed the public to expect miracles. But, vaccine acceptability will be contingent on a yet nebulous profile of safety. Therefore, we must proactively evaluate side effect reports and optimize vetted information for dissemination.
<br>
## Mission: Vetting Rumors and Results
To factcheck vaccine rumors/results in real-time to deliver side effect information to patients effectively.
<br>

## Output: Patient-centric Chatbot
We will answer the 3 questions regarding vaccine side effects that patients find most important.
1. Is it vaccine-related?
2. How long will it last?
3. What should I do?

## Scientific Approach: Evaluate Side Effect Rumors & Results
We will monitor social and news media, scientific literature, pharmaceutical industry filings, and government reports to identify emerging concerns about vaccine side effects. We will scientifically assess each new rumor using data and medical knowledge, arriving at a determination. Based on the strength of the evidence, we will communicate our findings via video (TikTok, Vimeo, YouTube) and safety dispatched (blog posts) on the main site.

## Tech Approach: SMS Chatbot
We will develop a chatbot to allowing users to describe their symptoms and learn if could be vaccine related. Serious side effects will be referred for medical attention. Basic management information will be provided for minor side effects, including how long symptoms are expected to last. The chatbot can be embedded in other websites for mass syndication, and will be accessible via SMS text and WhatsApp. Aggregate data on side effects can be used for situational awareness in pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology.
