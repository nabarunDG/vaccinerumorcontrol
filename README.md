*We are not throwin’ away our shot*
<br>
<br>
We want COVID vaccines to succeed and get on with our lives. And, reports of “90%+ effective” have primed the public to expect miracles. But, vaccine acceptability will be contingent on a yet nebulous profile of safety. Therefore, we must proactively evaluate side effect reports and optimize vetted information for dissemination.
<br>
# Mission: Vetting Rumors and Results
To factcheck vaccine side effect rumors and results in real-time. Deliver vetted information to patients effectively.<br>
<br>
mass vaccination + common side effects + ubiquitous mobile phones = millions searching for reliable info on handhelds<br>
<br>

```We are soliciting interest and funding to build a lightweight science-as-a-service tool. The rumor control website will require scientific expertise, and the chatbot will require software developers. Please WhatsApp (+1-919-260-3808) or email nab@unc.edu if interested.```

# See the Demo
In the demo we answer the 3 questions regarding vaccine side effects that patients find most important.
1. Is it vaccine-related?
2. How long will it last?
3. What should I do now?

# Data for Action
User-generated text can be mined for shifts in 

Unlike search engine trends and social media monitoring, we are 
The time between vaccination and onset of symptoms is the [single most important](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6447519/) element to determining if a side effect was caused by the vaccine. Unlike

# Four Insights from Experience
From years of deploying patient-centric health apps, we proceed with 4 central insights.

### 1. The "worried well" need encouragement to get second doses
Offering encouragement to those with minor expected side effects will be essential to overcome hesitancy for regimen completion.

### 2. Syndication speeds uptake
To rise above pandemic media saturation, a data tool must be easily propogated while fulfilling a fundamental public need, as the success of COVID tracker APIs demonstrates.

### 3. Patients expect instant feedback
As described in this [video](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/patients.md), patients with side effects expect instant  and compassionate feedback.

### 4. Patients are reluctant to download single-use reporting apps
[Based on our experience in 4 countries](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40264-019-00813-6), mobile apps for side effect reporting have limited uptake. The yet-unlaunched [CDC mobile app (V-SAFE)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html) focuses on *collecting* information, while [patients](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/patients.md) expect to *receive* information. <br>

# Scientific Approach: Evaluate Side Effect Rumors & Results
We will monitor social and news media, scientific literature, pharmaceutical industry filings, and government reports to identify emerging concerns about vaccine side effects. We will scientifically assess each new side effect (aka adverse event) using data and medical knowledge to determine causality.

|Vaccine|Side Effect|Status|
|--|--|--|
|Vaccine01|transverse myelitis (rare inflammation of the spinal cord)|unlikely ([details](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/softwaredev.md))|
|Vaccine01|impanted microchip|false ([details](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/softwaredev.md))|
|Vaccine02|chills|true and common ([details](https://nabarundg.github.io/vaccinerumorcontrol/docs/softwaredev.md))|

# Tech Approach: SMS and API Chatbot
We will develop a chatbot to allowing users to describe their symptoms and learn if could be vaccine related. Serious side effects will be referred for medical attention. Basic management information will be provided for minor side effects, including how long symptoms are expected to last. The chatbot can be embedded in other websites for mass syndication, and will be accessible via SMS text and WhatsApp. Aggregate data on side effects can be used for situational awareness in pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology.

## Recognition of Need
A [recent headline in *Science*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6520/1022?fbclid=IwAR1glSi-0GalPGx1ASJDzDPfyu91Wk-ODA_NbIYGlz2xrpjCRtceIdrcsPQ) summarizes the need: Public needs to prep for vaccine side effects
The professional society for side effect surveillance has been [warning about this concern](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40264-020-00941-4) for months. [Industry experts](https://www.mymedsandme.com/resources/whitepapers/impact-covid-19-vaccination-on-safety-reporting-and-liability) have been warning of the upcoming challenges. News media have also started recognizing the impending storm.
