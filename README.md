# COVID Vaccine Rumor Control
*Concept note for COVID vaccine side effect info chatbot*
<br>
<br>
We want COVID vaccines to succeed and get on with our lives. And, reports of “90%+ effective” have primed the public to expect miracles. But, vaccine acceptability will be contingent on a yet nebulous profile of safety. Therefore, we must act decisively now to find and evaluate concerns about side effects with scientific credibility.
<br>
## The Mission
To factcheck vaccine rumors in real-time and deliver side effect information effectively.
<br>

## The Approach
We will answer the 3 questions most important to patients regarding vaccine side effects:
1. Is it vaccine-related?
2. How long will it last?
3. What should I do?



To accomplish this, the scientific focus is to assess causality of side effects in a meaningful way for patients.


1. Identify and Evaluate Side Effect Rumors
We will monitor social and news media, scientific literature, pharmaceutical industry filings, and government reports to identify emerging concerns about vaccine side effects. We will scientifically assess each new rumor using data and medical knowledge, arriving at a determination. Based on the strength of the evidence, we will communicate our findings via video (TikTok, Vimeo, YouTube) and safety dispatched (blog posts) on the main site.
2. Create a Chatbot for Side Effect Information
We will develop a chatbot to allowing users to describe their symptoms and learn if could be vaccine related. Serious side effects will be referred for medical attention. Basic management information will be provided for minor side effects, including how long symptoms are expected to last. The chatbot can be embedded in other websites for mass syndication, and will be accessible via SMS text and WhatsApp. Aggregate data on side effects can be used for situational awareness in pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology.
